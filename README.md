# XYZ Chart

The XYZ Chart can be used to plot three-dimensional (or higher dimensional) datasets. 3D plots are useful for a number of applications including geographic plotting, multivariate analysis, and more.

The XYZ Chart includes typical 3D camera controls so that data can panned, zoomed, and rotated. This allows for straightforward analysis from various perspectives.

## Alpha

This plugin is currently in alpha. Many changes are expected so please pay attention to new versions being released.

## Implementation

The chart is built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org) via the excellent [React 3 Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and [React 3 Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei). The chart implements a (very) small 3D chart rendering library. We hope to extend this with more chart types in the future.
