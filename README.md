# Grafana 3D Scatter Plot Panel Plugin

This was created as part of the Q1 2022 Grafana Hackathon.

Built with [R3F](#https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber).

The Scatter Plot Plugin can plot data points in 3D space in perspective view and also allows limiting the data to a 2D scene on the axis desired *(XYZ)* in orthographic view.

## Features:
   * Switch between 3D and 2D scenes on selected axis
   * Ability to zoom, pan and rotate the 3D scene
   * Ability to zoom and pan the 2D scene
   * Show extra information when hovering a data point
   * Real-time refresh when data changes or when grid rescales

## There are multiple customization options:
   * Grid scale
   * Label intervals
   * XYZ axis colors
   * Label colors and date formatting
   * Particle size and colors
   * Skybox presets
   * Camera positioning and FOV

## Future improvements:
   * Add multiple dimensions e.g: color and data point size
   * Draw lines on the grids showing where a data point hits when hovered
